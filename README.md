## :heart_eyes_cat: Installation Instructions

<details>
  <summary>Prerequisites</summary>
  <p>Your employee data should be on an Excel spreadsheet, ready to be imported into a CSV file. Please ensure that each employee’s information should be spread out across a row, with their information in this order:</p>
  <p>1.	Employee ID</p>
  <p>2.	Employee name (First Name Last Name) - no commas or special characters in between</p>
  <p>3.	Department the employee belongs in</p>
  <p>4.	Employee’s position</p>
  <p>5.	Employee’s salary (only type in the number itself, no dollar signs or commas)</p>
  <p>6.	Employee’s birthdate (in YYYY-MM-DD format)</p>
  <p>7.	Employee’s manager’s ID (This ID should match the above employee ID of the manager)</p>
  <p>8.	Blank field (representing each employee’s User ID, to be filled out automatically by the application later, as employees make their accounts)</p>
  <p>9.	Employee’s email address</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Installation:</summary>
  <p>1.	Download PostgreSQL from https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html</p>

  <p>3.	Click “Initialize” to create a new server.</p>
  <p>4.	To start the server, click “start”.</p>
  <p>5.	Open your terminal and type: createdb <your desired database name></p>
  <p>6.	Type: psql</p>
  <p>7.	Type: \c <your newly created database name></p>
  <p>8.	Create the employee table:
  <p>CREATE TABLE main_app_employee \(</p>
  <p>Id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY</p>
  <p>employee_name VARCHAR(100),</p>
  <p>Department VARCHAR(100),</p>
  <p>Position VARCHAR(100),</p>
  <p>Salary DECIMAL(9, 2),</p>
  <p>Birthdate DATE,</p>
  <p>manager_id INTEGER,</p>
  <p>user_id SET DEFAULT NULL,</p>
  <p>employee_email VARCHAR(255);</p>
  <p>9.	Type: \copy main_app_employee FROM ‘/<path to your CSV file>/<your CSV file name>.csv’ WITH (FORMAT csv);</p>
  <p>10.	Go to neon.tech and make a new account. Alternatively, you may log in with an existing Google or GitHub account.</p>
  <p>11.	Once logged in, ensure that you stay logged in as long as you will use this database.</p>
  <p>12.	Open your terminal and input: psql -h pg.neon.tech</p>
  <p>13.	On your browser, go to https://heythere-hr-f3d27d8a0e61.herokuapp.com/</p>
  <p>14.	If you are a CEO or a president of the company, ask to the site administrator to make a superuser/admin account on your behalf.</p>
  <p>15.	If you are a manager of a department or a regular employee, you should be able to create an account using your email address.</p>
  <p>16.	You should now be able to see the imported database under the “employees” tab. If you are a superuser, you will be able to add, edit, or delete any employee, event, or PTO request. If you are a manager, you will be able to add, edit, or delete any employee who is under your supervision in your department. You will be able to edit your own information, but you will not be able to delete yourself. If you are a regular employee, you will be able to edit your own information only. As a manager or an employee, you may choose to attend any event that the employer creates on this page. You may also cancel your attendance at any time. As an employee, you may request time off by clicking “Add PTO Request” button. Once submitted, it will be automatically visible on the PTO Requests section of the website, with a “pending” status. Only the superuser/employer will be able to approve, deny, or delete this request.</p>

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Hurdles
- [ ] Getting the dropdown menu to work in the nav bar
- [ ] Since it wasn’t realistic to pull any publicly available online information of private employee information of any given company, we used a mock data of 52 made-up employees, then used Django’s “loaddata” feature to store the data internally in a file named db.json. We also imported the same data into PSQL using the COPY command. The largest hurdle we had to overcome was that when we are doing CRUD operations on the employee model, Django seems to create objects/instances of the model within the project, and not in the PSQL database itself. So when we were each testing out the CRUD operations locally on our own computers, it resulted in primary key conflicts/duplicates each time we pulled/pushed our code from GitHub. The solution was to manually reset the key sequence using PSQL commands, which solved the problem each time, but we were not able to hard code it so that it would do it automatically. We are thinking that in the future, it would be best to leave the testing to one developer, so that each of our databases remain consistent and without conflicts.
- [ ] Designing and implementing the ERD to accurately match the nature of our project. We ran into many issues with Foreign Keys, Many to many relationships, etc.
- [ ] Learning and utilizing materialize, since the format is strict unlike customized CSS which is more flexible

## :dart: Next Steps
- [ ] Replace home page in pre-logged area
- [ ] Create and display announcements in home page, along with events
- [ ] Search filter for employees
- [ ] Display multiple event cards on the same row
- [ ] Memos
